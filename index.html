      <h3>
        Adidas AG (German: [ˈʔadiˌdas] (listen))[4] is a German athletic apparel
        and footwear corporation headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria,
        Germany. It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the
        second largest in the world, after Nike.[5][6] It is the holding company
        for the Adidas Group, which consists 8.33% stake of the football club
        Bayern München,[7] and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology
        company. Adidas's revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion.[3] The
        company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house; he was
        joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder
        Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted
        in the development of spiked running shoes (spikes) for multiple
        athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he
        transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising
        canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens to use
        his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a
        breakdown in the relationship between the brothers, Adolf created Adidas
        and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas's business rival.[1]
        The three stripes are Adidas's identity mark, having been used on the
        company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid. The branding,
        which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for
        the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey,[8][9] became so
        successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company
