      NewsToday adidas announced it will begin selling some of the remaining
      inventory of adidas YEEZY products, with an initial release end of May
      2023. A range of existing designs will be available exclusively through
      adidas.com/yeezy and the adidas CONFIRMED app. A significant amount will
      be donated to selected organizations working to combat discrimination and
      hate, including racism and antisemitism. These include but are not limited
      to the Anti-Defamation League(ADL) and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd
      Institute for Social Change. The release will mark the first time that
      products have been available to consumers since adidas terminated the
      YEEZY partnership in October 2022. The products will be existing designs
      and designs initiated in 2022 for sale in 2023. Additional releases of
      existing inventory are currently under consideration, but timing is yet to
      be determined. Today’s announcement has no immediate impact on the
      company’s current financial guidance for 2023. Since terminating the YEEZY
      partnership in October, adidas has been exploring multiple scenarios for
      the potential use of the existing YEEZY inventory. The process involved
      seeking feedback and listening to a diverse group of employees,
      organizations, communities, and consumers for how to responsibly manage
      the existing product. The company went ahead with already committed
      production orders after the partnership was terminated. This was done to
      help protect its supply chain partners from being negatively affected by
      cancellations. adidas CEO Bjørn Gulden said: “After careful consideration,
      we have decided to begin releasing some of the remaining adidas YEEZY
      products. Selling and donating was the preferred option among all
      organizations and stakeholders we spoke to. We believe this is the best
      solution as it respects the created designs and produced shoes, it works
      for our people, resolves an inventory problem, and will have a positive
      impact in our communities. There is no place in sport or society for hate
      of any kind and we remain committed to fighting against it.” “At a time
      when antisemitism has reached historic levels in the U.S. and is rising
      globally, we appreciate how adidas turned a negative situation into a very
      positive outcome. They have shown real thoughtfulness in engaging with
      community organizations working to combat this pernicious and stubborn
      hatred,” said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO. “Their leadership, in not
      only condemning anti-Jewish hate but lending their support for education
      and other initiatives, is exemplary and a model for other public companies
      to emulate. We thank them for their ongoing dialogue around their
      remaining inventory and their vested interest in tackling issues of
      prejudice and hate.” adidas will partner with the Philonise & Keeta Floyd
      Institute for Social Change run by Philonise Floyd, the brother of George
      Floyd, to drive Community programs through sport and education, working
      together to leave a lasting legacy.
